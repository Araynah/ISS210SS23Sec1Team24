                <div class="container"><p>Have you ever heard the heartbreaking story of Serena Williams? She's one of the most celebrated tennis players of all time, with 23 Grand Slam titles to her name. But did you know that during her pregnancy, she experienced a life-threatening complication due to a history of blood clots? Despite her fame and wealth, Serena's experience is far from unique. The most recent statistics (2014–2017) of the pregnancy-related mortality ratio by race/ethnicity show that non-Hispanic Black women experience 41.7 deaths per 100 000 live births as compared with 13.4 deaths per 100 000 in non-Hispanic White women, representing nearly a 4-fold higher risk of death. Indigenous women in the United States experience 29.7 deaths per 100 000, representing more than a 2-fold higher risk of death compared with the non-Hispanic White referent group. This shocking statistic highlights the importance of not singling one identity like race, gender, or class when searching for health disparities but also the urgent need for a more inclusive and equitable healthcare system.</p>
                <div class="container"><p>This issue affects not just pregnant women like Serena Williams, but also individuals from other marginalized communities who face barriers to healthcare access and experience bias in the healthcare system.</p>
                <div class="container"><p>At this website, we are passionate about addressing these issues and advocating for a more inclusive and equitable healthcare system. Our goal is to increase awareness, reduce healthcare disparities, and improve access to care and quality of care for marginalized populations. We believe that everyone deserves access to high-quality healthcare, regardless of their race or gender.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"> Literacy throughout various U.S. government healthcare organizations often forget to include that gender and race and ethnicity are not social categories to look at individuall, but rather consider the possibility that these identities, among others, can intersect each other in relation to healthcare. Without recognizing the intersectionality of gender and race, the privileges and oppression that maintain the inequities in the healthcare system will maintain itself. From an intersectionality point of view, attempting to understand or address health disparities via a single analytical category (e.g., gender or race or sexual orientation), as the DHHS report on health disparities implies, elides the complex ways in which multiple social categories intersect with social discrimination based on those multiple intersecting categories to create disparity and social inequality in health (Bowleg). Because people from multiple historically oppressed and marginalized populations are its starting point, intersectionality examines the health of these populations in their own context and from their vantage point rather than their deviation from the norms of White middle-class people (Bowleg). </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> From an intersectionality perspective, a middle-class Latina lesbian’s negative experiences at her physician’s office are linked to multiple and interlocking sexism, heterosexism, and racism at the macro level. Her microlevel experiences at the intersection of her race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender correspond with empirically documented evidence of the heterosexism that lesbian and bisexual women often encounter when they seek health care services and the intersection of racism and sexism well documented in research on racial/ethnic minority women’s health care experiences (Bowleg).</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> Much of the research on lesbian and bisexual women’s experiences in health care settings stems from research with predominantly White middle-class lesbian and bisexual women. Similarly, much of the research on racial/ethnic minority women’s experiences in health care settings does not include or report sexual orientation data or presumes heterosexuality, thereby limiting an in-depth understanding of women’s experiences in health care settings beyond the intersections of gender and race (Bowleg).</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"> The video above explains how important post-discharge treatment is.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> Disparities in healthcare are also apparent in post-discharge treatment. Being discharged from the hospital does not necessarily mean that treatment is over. The care that a patient receives after being discharged will affect the likelihood of being readmitted to the hospital (Heath). So, it is important that patients receive good aftercare in the first place so they do not have to come back for treatment again, which would be a drain on their resources and a risk to their health.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> There have been multiple studies on the racial disparities in post-discharge healthcare, which showcases the racial disparities in treatment. In a study on trauma patient’s utilization of post-discharge rehabilitation between African Americans and Caucasian trauma patients, African Americans were less likely to “receive rehabilitation services” and less likely to “be seen for an injury-related outpatient visit” (Chun Fat). Given that these treatments are important in reducing the long-term effects of their trauma injury, the racial disparities in treatment could contribute to “worse long-term trauma outcomes” (Chun Fat). </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> In another study that retrospectively analyzed data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2012-2018, the researchers found that in comparison to white patients, black patients were “at a higher risk of re-admission and re-operation after surgery” and had a higher association with morbidity – a medical problem that is caused by treatment – and mortality (Azin). The researchers found that their findings support that part of the reason for the racial disparity in the survival rate is due to the “suboptimal systems” that black people receive care from (Azin).</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> These are long lasting or life ending consequences that occur because of the different treatment patients receive based on their race.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>Summary:</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>The article from the CDC discusses the impact of racism on health disparities among minority populations in the United States. It provides information on the various ways in which racism affects the physical and mental health of individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups, including increased stress, trauma, and chronic illnesses.The article also highlights the social determinants of health and how systemic racism contributes to health disparities by limiting access to resources such as education, employment, and healthcare. For instance, individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to live in areas with high levels of pollution and limited access to healthy foods.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>What can be done:</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>Educate yourself: It is essential to educate yourself about the history and impact of racism in healthcare. This can help you understand the issues and identify areas where change is needed.
Speak up: If you witness or experience racism in healthcare, speak up about it. This can be difficult, but it is important to hold healthcare providers and institutions accountable for their actions.
Advocate for change: Work with community organizations and healthcare providers to advocate for policy changes that can address racism in healthcare. This can include pushing for diversity and inclusion training, creating accountability mechanisms for discriminatory behavior, and improving access to healthcare for marginalized communities.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"> This video gives light to what maternal disparities women of color face. </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> There have been long-standing racial disparities in maternal and infant health understanding these disparities and getting educated could possibly lead to much change in maternal health. During the era of slavery in the United States, Black women were often used as breeders and forced to have children to increase the slave population. This contributed to a perception of Black women as hyper-fertile and less deserving of proper medical care. </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> In the article, the author discusses the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the US, it discusses how African American and indigenous (American Indian/Alaska Native) women are disproportionately affected. They have a higher risk of developing CVD and experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preeclampsia and preterm birth. The author argues that a multidisciplinary approach is needed to address this issue, including prenatal care providers, obstetricians, cardiologists, and public health officials. They suggest strategies such as improving access to care, increasing awareness and education, and promoting research to identify effective interventions that so happened been ignored for so long. </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> Research has also highlighted the role of racism and discrimination plays in driving racial disparities in maternal and infant health. In a study, Jolivet et al. (2019) found that indigenous, Hispanic, and Black women reported significantly higher rates of mistreatment (such as shouting and scolding, ignoring or refusing requests for help) during the course of their pregnancy.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> In conclusion racial disparities in maternal and infant health in the United States are deeply rooted in historical practices of using Black women as breeders during slavery, perpetuating a perception of hyper-fertility and less deserving of proper medical care. These disparities continue to persist today, with African American and indigenous women disproportionately affected by adverse pregnancy outcomes and cardiovascular disease. A multidisciplinary approach that addresses systemic racism, improves access to care, and promotes research for effective interventions is necessary to combat these disparities and improve maternal and infant health outcomes for all women. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"> Using data from the 1997–2001 waves of the National Health Interview Survey, the analysis examines differences in men and women's self-rated health, functional limitations, and life-threatening medical conditions for whites, blacks, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans, and shows that how the gender, race and ethnicity is creating inequalities in health conditions and what should be noticed from the charts. The researchers come up with two main questions to focus on: </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> What is the magnitude of gender differences in health within racial and ethnic groups? </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> Does the size of gender differences in health vary across racial and ethnic groups? </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> Based on these two main questions, the researcher figured out a way to create a very detailed survey in order to collect data.
They split different races and ethnicities into groups, and then also split people in smaller groups depending on their ages, which could be the reason that is affecting their health conditions. The survey is separated as a 5 score rating of the self health condition, 5 as in very good and 0 as in very poor. Other than self health condition rating, they also have questions about disabilities, questions about the amount of difficulty they experienced performing 12 different tasks, but the answers should either be “having any functional limitations” or “do not have any functional limitations”. They also had questions about “any life threatening medical condition or no. Finally, they included a measure of depressive mood as previous research has demonstrated that women have higher rates of depressive disorders than men, and racial minorities have higher rates of depressive symptoms and major depression than whites, which may influence their self-reported health status.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> In results, looking at gender differences within racial/ethnic groups provides a partial picture of the consequences of the complicated interplay of racial/ethnic and gender stratification. While women may consistently fare worse relative to men in their same racial/ethnic group, both men and women in some racial/ethnic groups enjoy advantaged health outcomes compared to others. For example, white men and women (9.7% and 10.9%) and Mexican men and women (10.6% and 13.3%) have the lowest rates of reporting fair-to-poor self-rated health compared to all other racial/ethnic-by-gender groups. Mexican men and women are also less likely than any other group to report having life-threatening conditions (18.1% and 23.9%, respectively). At the other end of the race-by-gender hierarchy, black women have the highest rates of life-threatening conditions (39%) and are nearly twice as likely as white men and women to rate their health as fair-to-poor (18.1% compared to 10.9% and 9.7%, respectively). </p>
