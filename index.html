It is a good idea to start with an anecdote and this section will be graded on investment and enthusiasm. Remember, people are moved by opinions and passion. You may want to incorporate a story that will influence people to care. You can add images and videos that speak to this anecdote, either in the portfolio section, where you should have a mix of mediums, including images, videos, evidence, and calls to action, or you can add one powerful image or video here by copying and pasting the code into this divider (I recommend the former so that it is not too busy). Once you have captured your audience's attention and got them invested, introduce your main argument and scholars. This section should include the "so-what?" of your argument. This container will expand as needed but still strive for concision.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"> Literacy throughout various U.S. government healthcare organizations often forget to include that gender and race and ethnicity are not social categories to look at individuall, but rather consider the possibility that these identities, among others, can intersect each other in relation to healthcare. Without recognizing the intersectionality of gender and race, the privileges and oppression that maintain the inequities in the healthcare system will maintain itself. From an intersectionality point of view, attempting to understand or address health disparities via a single analytical category (e.g., gender or race or sexual orientation), as the DHHS report on health disparities implies, elides the complex ways in which multiple social categories intersect with social discrimination based on those multiple intersecting categories to create disparity and social inequality in health (Bowleg). Because people from multiple historically oppressed and marginalized populations are its starting point, intersectionality examines the health of these populations in their own context and from their vantage point rather than their deviation from the norms of White middle-class people (Bowleg). </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> From an intersectionality perspective, a middle-class Latina lesbian’s negative experiences at her physician’s office are linked to multiple and interlocking sexism, heterosexism, and racism at the macro level. Her microlevel experiences at the intersection of her race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender correspond with empirically documented evidence of the heterosexism that lesbian and bisexual women often encounter when they seek health care services and the intersection of racism and sexism well documented in research on racial/ethnic minority women’s health care experiences (Bowleg).</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> Much of the research on lesbian and bisexual women’s experiences in health care settings stems from research with predominantly White middle-class lesbian and bisexual women. Similarly, much of the research on racial/ethnic minority women’s experiences in health care settings does not include or report sexual orientation data or presumes heterosexuality, thereby limiting an in-depth understanding of women’s experiences in health care settings beyond the intersections of gender and race (Bowleg).</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> Intersectionality provides a unifying language and theoretical framework for public health scholars who are already engaged in investigating intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, SES, and disability to reduce and eliminate health disparities. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"> The video above explains how important post-discharge treatment is.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> Disparities in healthcare are also apparent in post-discharge treatment. Being discharged from the hospital does not necessarily mean that treatment is over. The care that a patient receives after being discharged will affect the likelihood of being readmitted to the hospital (Heath). So, it is important that patients receive good aftercare in the first place so they do not have to come back for treatment again, which would be a drain on their resources and a risk to their health.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> There have been multiple studies on the racial disparities in post-discharge healthcare, which showcases the racial disparities in treatment. In a study on trauma patient’s utilization of post-discharge rehabilitation between African Americans and Caucasian trauma patients, African Americans were less likely to “receive rehabilitation services” and less likely to “be seen for an injury-related outpatient visit” (Chun Fat). Given that these treatments are important in reducing the long-term effects of their trauma injury, the racial disparities in treatment could contribute to “worse long-term trauma outcomes” (Chun Fat). </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> In another study that retrospectively analyzed data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2012-2018, the researchers found that in comparison to white patients, black patients were “at a higher risk of re-admission and re-operation after surgery” and had a higher association with morbidity – a medical problem that is caused by treatment – and mortality (Azin). The researchers found that their findings support that part of the reason for the racial disparity in the survival rate is due to the “suboptimal systems” that black people receive care from (Azin).</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> These are long lasting or life ending consequences that occur because of the different treatment patients receive based on their race.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>Summary:</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>The article from the CDC discusses the impact of racism on health disparities among minority populations in the United States. It provides information on the various ways in which racism affects the physical and mental health of individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups, including increased stress, trauma, and chronic illnesses.The article also highlights the social determinants of health and how systemic racism contributes to health disparities by limiting access to resources such as education, employment, and healthcare. For instance, individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to live in areas with high levels of pollution and limited access to healthy foods.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>What can be done:</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>Educate yourself: It is essential to educate yourself about the history and impact of racism in healthcare. This can help you understand the issues and identify areas where change is needed.
Speak up: If you witness or experience racism in healthcare, speak up about it. This can be difficult, but it is important to hold healthcare providers and institutions accountable for their actions.
Advocate for change: Work with community organizations and healthcare providers to advocate for policy changes that can address racism in healthcare. This can include pushing for diversity and inclusion training, creating accountability mechanisms for discriminatory behavior, and improving access to healthcare for marginalized communities.</p>
